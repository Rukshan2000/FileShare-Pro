This project and everyone participating in it is governed by our [Code of Conduct](CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md). By participating, you are expected to uphold this code. Please report unacceptable behavior to the project maintainers.

## üöÄ Getting Started

### Development Environment Setup

1. **Fork the repository**
   - Click the "Fork" button at the top right of the repository page
   - Clone your fork: `git clone https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/FileShare-Pro.git`

2. **Set up the development environment**
   ```bash
   cd FileShare-Pro
   python3 -m venv venv
   source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows: venv\Scripts\activate

### Environment Configuration
- The application uses Flask development mode by default
- File uploads are limited to 100MB
- Automatic cleanup removes files older than 7 days
- Authentication is required for all routes except login

### Running Tests
The project includes a comprehensive test suite using pytest:

```bash
# Run all tests
pytest

# Run with coverage report
pytest --cov=. --cov-report=html

# Run specific test file
pytest tests/test_app.py

# Run tests in watch mode (requires pytest-watch)
pytest-watch
```

Test files are located in the `tests/` directory and follow the naming convention `test_*.py`.

## üìù Coding Standards

### Python Code Style
- Follow **PEP 8** guidelines using automated tools
- Code formatting is handled by **Black** (line length: 88 characters)
- Import sorting is managed by **isort**
- Code quality is enforced by **flake8**
- Security scanning with **bandit**
- Use meaningful variable and function names
- Add docstrings for functions and classes
- Keep functions focused and small
- Use type hints where appropriate

#### Automated Code Formatting
The project uses several tools to maintain code quality:

```bash
# Format code with Black
black .

# Sort imports with isort
isort .

# Check code quality with flake8
flake8 .

# Run security scan with bandit
bandit -r . -x tests

# Or run all checks at once with pre-commit
pre-commit run --all-files
```

#### Configuration Files
- **pyproject.toml**: Configuration for Black, isort, pytest, and bandit
- **.editorconfig**: Editor settings for consistent coding style
- **.pre-commit-config.yaml**: Pre-commit hooks configuration

```python
def create_user(username: str, password: str, role: str = 'user') -> tuple[bool, str]:
    """Create a new user account.

    Args:
        username: The username for the new account
        password: The password for the new account
        role: The role for the user (default: 'user')

    Returns:
        Tuple of (success: bool, message: str)
    """
    # Implementation here
```

### Frontend Code Style
- Use consistent indentation (2 spaces)
- Write semantic HTML
- Use CSS custom properties for theming
- Add comments for complex JavaScript logic
- Follow existing naming conventions

### Git Commit Messages
Use clear, descriptive commit messages:

```
feat: add user authentication system
fix: resolve file upload progress bar issue
docs: update API documentation for new endpoints
refactor: improve file organization logic
test: add unit tests for user management
```

## Reporting a Vulnerability

The FileShare Pro team takes security bugs seriously. We appreciate your efforts to responsibly disclose your findings, and will make every effort to acknowledge your contributions.

### How to Report a Security Vulnerability

**Please do not report security vulnerabilities through public GitHub issues.**

Instead, please report them via email to: **security@your-domain.com** (replace with actual email)

Include the following information in your report:

- Type of issue (e.g. buffer overflow, SQL injection, cross-site scripting, etc.)
- Full paths of source file(s) related to the manifestation of the issue
- The location of the affected source code (tag/branch/commit or direct URL)
- Any special configuration required to reproduce the issue
- Step-by-step instructions to reproduce the issue
- Proof-of-concept or exploit code (if possible)
- Impact of the issue, including how an attacker might exploit the issue

### Response Timeline

- We will acknowledge receipt of your vulnerability report within 48 hours
- We will send you regular updates about our progress every 5 business days
- If the issue is accepted, we will work on a fix and release timeline
- We will notify you when the issue is fixed

### Safe Harbor

We support safe harbor for security researchers who:

- Make a good faith effort to avoid privacy violations, destruction of data, and interruption or degradation of our service
- Only interact with accounts you own or with explicit permission of the account holder
- Do not access unnecessary or excessive amounts of data
- Do not modify or delete any data
- Do not share, redistribute, or use data for any purpose other than security research
- Report any additional vulnerabilities you discover in the course of your research
- Do not use physical or social engineering techniques

### Recognition

We believe in recognizing the valuable work of security researchers. With your permission, we will:

- Publicly acknowledge your responsible disclosure
- Include you in our security acknowledgments
- Work with you on coordinated disclosure timing

### Security Best Practices for Users

As a user of FileShare Pro, you can help keep your instance secure by:

1. **Keep Updated**: Always run the latest version of FileShare Pro
2. **Strong Authentication**: Use strong, unique passwords for all accounts
3. **HTTPS Only**: Always use HTTPS in production environments
4. **Regular Backups**: Maintain regular backups of your data
5. **Monitor Logs**: Regularly check logs for suspicious activity
6. **Limit Permissions**: Follow the principle of least privilege for user accounts
7. **Network Security**: Use firewalls and other network security measures
8. **File Scanning**: Consider implementing file scanning for uploads

### Security Features

FileShare Pro includes several security features:

- User authentication and authorization
- File type validation
- Upload size limits
- Session management
- CSRF protection (when properly configured)
- Path traversal protection

### Known Security Considerations

- The application should be run behind a reverse proxy in production
- File uploads should be scanned for malware in production environments
- Regular security audits are recommended for production deployments
- Consider implementing rate limiting for API endpoints

For more information about securing your FileShare Pro deployment, please see the [Production Deployment Guide](DEPLOYMENT.md).
